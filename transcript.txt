Hi, there!
My name Michael (in pasport Mikhail).
I am very honored to tell you about Ajax and Promises.
As all of you know web applications work with
client-server model.
Client sends request, server answers.
In traditional web application model
server makes page and sends all of its components as one thing.
And we need wait when it was loaded.
AJAX is a developer's dream, because...
You may read this on slide... Ready?
Ajax is a name of technology. It means asynchronus Javascript and XML. 
But it understands other formats like JSON
Ajax let us send request only on what we want to receive
For example only name of customer.
And JavaScript adds name of customer in user interface on the page.
You may make request with built-in object XMLHTTPRequest.
The XMLHTTPRequest has some methods and properties.
In this example we use new method to create new XMLHttpRequest.
Then we define a function to be called when readyState property changed.
In function we check readyState property and if all OK we change DOM element.
Simply?
So we already know what is AJAX. How about a Promise?
In our life promise mean to tell someone that you will certainly do something
For example : I promise i will be better )
Often our promises is empty promises.
In JavaScript Promise is an object.
It gives not empty promises.
Promise returns its state and result of executor .
Executor is a function passed to new promise.
State and result are internal property of object returned promise.
At the beginning, result is undefined, state is pending .
